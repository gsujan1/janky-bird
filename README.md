# janky-bird
flappy bird clone using pygame

requirements:
1. python3
2. pygame

how to play:
1. press space to flap

This game is obviously a work in progress, its horribly structured and cobbled together right now, but I will continue to update it as I learn more about the Python programming language and the Pygame library. The ultimate goal is to sic an AI on a hopefully more polished version of this game.
